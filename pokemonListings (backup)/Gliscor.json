Due to its flexibility, Gliscor finds itself on many archetypes in OU, ranging from bulky offense to stall. Gliscor\u2019s amazing defensive typing, good natural bulk, and excellent recovery through Poison Heal and Roost allow it to check prominent Pokemon like Heatran and Toxapex. However, Gliscor faces competition from other Ground-types that have a superior offensive presence, such as Landorus-T and Garchomp. Moreover, its typing also leaves it prone to prominent Pokemon like Greninja, Tapu Bulu, and Mega Latias.\n", "strategies' format": "OU", "strategies": [{"name": "Stealth Rock", "stats": [247, 226, 299, 113, 205, 286], "type": ["Ground", "Flying"], "usage": "Set up Stealth Rock early in games against Pokemon that don't threaten Gliscor or are forced out, such as Clefable without Calm Mind and Heatran, so that the opponent's Pokemon are worn down quicker; however, be wary of Ice Beam and Inferno Overdrive from each of these Pokemon, respectively. Use U-turn liberally so that Gliscor can pivot into wallbreakers often and they can decimate the opposing team. Use Roost after switching into Pokemon like Heatran so that Gliscor can check them later on in the match. Avoid staying in and using Earthquake too much with Gliscor, as it gives free momentum to Pokemon such as Choice Scarf Landorus-T and Mega Latios, but use it if need be. Most of the time, you should use U-turn when you believe a Ground-immune Pokemon such as Landorus or Mega Latios is coming in to maintain offensive pressure.", "moves": [["Stealth Rock"], ["Earthquake"], ["Toxic"], ["Roost"]], "item": [" Toxic Orb"], "ability": ["Poison Heal"], "nature": ["Jolly"], "ev spread": [244, 0, 52, 0, 76, 136], "iv spread": [31, 31, 31, 31, 31, 31]}, {"name": "Swords Dance", "stats": [247, 226, 299, 113, 205, 286], "type": ["Ground", "Flying"], "usage": "Ensure that Gliscor's Toxic Orb safely activates before switching it into Pokemon that can cripple it such as Lava Plume Heatran, Knock Off Mawile, or Scald Toxapex.
