    "overview": "Access to Chlorophyll and a boosting move in Swords Dance allows Sawsbuck to become a formidable sweeper under sun, outspeeding every unboosted threat in the PU metagame, including Choice Scarf users such as Primeape and Togedemaru, even with an Adamant nature. One of Sawsbuck's main perks over other sun-based sweepers is its access to Jump Kick, which enables it to easily whistle past Steel-types such as Aggron and Alolan Sandslash, threats that the likes of Leafeon otherwise struggle to deal with. STAB Double-Edge, boosted by Swords Dance and Normalium Z, also allows Sawsbuck to break through physically defensive walls like Weezing and Tangela. Unfortunately, despite Sawsbuck's solid Speed, it's still dependent on sun being active to function, as threats such as Jynx and Primeape outspeed it otherwise and OHKO it. Sawsbuck's defensive typing also gives it six weaknesses to common types including Fighting, Flying, and Ice, making it easy to revenge kill should sun not be up. Users of Mach Punch such as Hitmonchan and Gurdurr are especially threatening, as they always hit Sawsbuck first with a super effective move and punch through its mediocre defenses. Furthermore, setup is mandatory in order for Sawsbuck to power through foes, and finding time to set up is difficult given its several aforementioned weaknesses. The prevalence of bulky Calm Mind Oricorio-G is a major roadblock for Sawsbuck, as it possesses a resistance or immunity to all of its attacks. Lastly, Sawsbuck competes with Leafeon and other Chlorophyll users such as Shiftry for a teamslot, as these Pokemon possess their own useful traits such as high physical bulk and STAB priority in Sucker Punch, respectively.\n",

            "usage": "Sawsbuck serves as both a wallbreaker and late-game sweeper. It can utilize Swords Dance and Normalium Z to punch holes through walls for other teammates, while at the same time it can put its impeccable Speed tier to use to clean up late-game. Since Sawsbuck's frailty and common weaknesses prevent it from reliably switching directly into attacks, bring it in safely through means of momentum from Pokemon like Mesprit and Volbeat, as they preserve Sawsbuck's limited longevity. Feel free to set up on Pokemon such as Audino, Altaria, and Clefairy lacking Thunder Wave, as due to their passive nature and poor matchup, Sawsbuck threatens to break through them. Sawsbuck can additionally pressure Pokemon like Lanturn and Silvally-Water, as while they sometimes carry Ice Beam, the prospect of Sawsbuck's Horn Leech is often enough to force a switch. An opponent may try using Protect with Pokemon like Audino and Regirock or otherwise try switching out in order to stall out sun turns, which makes for another opportunity to utilize Swords Dance. Save Sawsbuck's Z-Move for dire situations, as it's an important tool for breaking through walls as well as preventing Double-Edge's recoil. Sawsbuck will fail to break through Pokemon like Weezing and Tangela if they're healthy and Sawsbuck can no longer use its Z-Crystal. Using Breakneck Blitz can also help Sawsbuck win over matchups against powerful offensive threats such as Drampa and Alolan Exeggutor, which can otherwise survive an unboosted Double-Edge if kept relatively healthy.",
