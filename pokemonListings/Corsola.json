Unfortunately, Corsola doesn't really accomplish anything besides setting Stealth Rock and fainting. Omastar, Clefairy, and Regirock fulfill this role with a lot more success because of their better stats and, with the exception of Omastar, typing. Regirock is especially noteworthy because it fills the same role, checks very similar Pokemon, and generally has more to offer in a team slot.\n", "strategies' format": "PU", "strategies": [], "counters": [], "credits": []}
