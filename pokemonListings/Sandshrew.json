However, Sandshrew can still use Knock Off and has a much better defensive typing. It is also largely outclassed by Drilbur in its role as a Stealth Rock and Rapid Spin user, though it has a higher Defense stat and access to the previously mentioned Knock Off. Furthermore, with the rise of Staryu, Sandshrew has become even more niche due to Staryu's ability to clear away Sandshrew's hazards and completely force it out with the threat of a Scald.\n", "strategies' format": "LC", "strategies": [{"name": "Bulky Support", "stats": [145, 247, 225, 68, 105, 165], "type": ["Ground"], "usage": "Always be careful of Flying-types such as Doduo and especially Vullaby, as Sandshrew can't do much against any of them with its lack of coverage. Baiting in Staryu with Stealth Rock can be a valid option if Sandshrew is paired with a good Staryu check, but this should be done very sparingly. Since Pumpkaboo and Gastly are common switch-ins to Rapid Spin, using Knock Off when predicting them to come in can cripple the former and KO the latter. Be aware of Sandshrew's low Special Defense; it can be easily KOed by many special attackers because of it.", "moves": [["Rapid Spin"], ["Stealth Rock"], ["Earthquake"], ["Knock Off"]], "item": [" Eviolite"], "ability": ["Sand Rush"], "nature": ["Adamant"], "ev spread": [36, 156, 76, 0, 36, 196], "iv spread": [31, 31, 31, 31, 31, 31]}], "counters": ["Water-types", "Entry Hazard Removers", "Special Attackers", "Grass-types", "Flying-types"], "credits": ["Written by Drew", "Quality checked by Fiend, Rowan,  and OP", "Grammar checked by Haund and CryoGyro"]}
