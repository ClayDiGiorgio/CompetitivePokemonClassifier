Additionally, it naturally outspeeds very fast Pokemon such as Virizion, Salazzle, and Noivern, all of which pose an issue to offensive teams. Swellow also has coverage moves that can hit Pokemon that resist Boomburst and U-turn to give it momentum, allowing it to perform well even against defensive teams. However, Swellow is incredibly frail and is almost always 2HKOed if not OHKOed by most neutral hits. Furthermore, being a Flying-type hinders its ability to spam U-turn when Stealth Rock is on the field.\n", "strategies' format": "RU", "strategies": [{"name": "Boomburst", "stats": [156, 185, 157, 249, 136, 383], "type": ["Normal", "Flying"], "usage": "The main purpose for using Swellow is to be able to use Boomburst as often as possible. Due to this, Swellow can be used both as a wallbreaker and as a late-game cleaner due to its Speed and power. It should be used as a wallbreaker versus teams that have Steelix as the premier Steel-type and no bulky Rock-types like Gigalith and Rhyperior. However, if the opposing team has Normal-type checks, use U-turn in order to pivot out of them and switch to a Pokemon that fares well against those checks. Also, having entry hazards on the opposing field makes it easier for Swellow to wear its checks down, as most of them are grounded.", "moves": [["Boomburst"], ["U-turn"], ["Heat Wave"], ["Air Slash"]], "item": [" Choice Specs"], "ability": ["Scrappy"], "nature": ["Timid"], "ev spread": [0, 0, 4, 252, 0, 252], "iv spread": [31, 31, 31, 31, 31, 31]}], "counters": ["Rock- and Steel-types", "Specially Defensive Pokemon", "Choice Scarf Pokemon", "Priority Users"], "credits": ["Written by Arifeen", "Quality checked by col49, Avocado,  and Kushalos", "Grammar checked by Fireflame479 and CryoGyro"]}
